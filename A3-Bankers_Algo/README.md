CMPUT 397 Assignment 3 - Stephen Just
=====================================

This program is intended to be a simulation of Banker's
Algorithm.

I say "intended" because the assignment specification did not
actually require us to keep track of the different states as
Banker's Algorithm does, because in the assignment specification,
all resource requests were for the maximum possible allocation.
